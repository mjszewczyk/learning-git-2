    <h1>Ed Sheeran - Perfect</h1>
    <p>I found a love for me
    Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
    Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
    Oh, I never knew you were
    The someone waiting for me
    'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
    Not knowing what it was
    I will not give you up this time
    But darling, just kiss me slow,
    Your heart is all I own
    And in your eyes, you're holding mine</p>
    <p>Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
    With you between my arms
    Barefoot on the grass, listening
    To our favourite song
    When you said you looked a mess,
    I whispered underneath my breath
    But you heard it, darling,
    You look perfect tonight</p>
      <p>Well I found a woman,
    Stronger than anyone I know
    She shares my dreams, I hope
    That someday I'll share her home
    I found a love, to carry more
    Than just my secrets
    To carry love, to carry children
    Of our own</p>
    <p>We are still kids, but
    We're so in love
    Fighting against all odds
    I know we'll be alright this time
    Darling, just hold my hand
    Be my girl, I'll be your man
    I see my future in your eyes</p>
    <p>Baby, I'm dancing in the dark,
    With you between my arms
    Barefoot on the grass, listening
    To our favourite song
    When I saw you in that dress,
    Looking so beautiful
    I don't deserve this, darling,
    You look perfect tonight</p>
    <p>Baby, I'm dancing in the dark,
    With you between my arms
    Barefoot on the grass,
    Listening to our favourite song
    I have faith in what I see
    Now I know I have met an angel
    In person, and she looks perfect
    I don't deserve this
    You look perfect tonight</p>
