    <h1>Ed Sheeran - Perfect</h1>
    <p>I found a love for me
    Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
    Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
    Oh, I never knew you were
    The someone waiting for me
    'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
    Not knowing what it was
    I will not give you up this time
    But darling, just kiss me slow,
    Your heart is all I own
    And in your eyes, you're holding mine</p>
    <p>Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
    With you between my arms
    Barefoot on the grass, listening
    To our favourite song
    When you said you looked a mess,
    I whispered underneath my breath
    But you heard it, darling,
    You look perfect tonight</p>
